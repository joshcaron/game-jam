# Game Quest 7
## One mask's journey, to the sky, to hit a button, and save the world.
-----------------------------------
### Overview
Starting on November 17th at 11:00AM, Northeastern University Game Design Club hosted a "Game Jam", where the challenge was to create a game from scratch within the next 32 hours. Working through the night, this was the end result...

### Story
The day of the Game Jam changed everything. The head of the Game Design Department, Mark, celebrated his birthday on the same day. His wish was for everybody's games to come to life. Unfortunately, they did!

Starting off on Northeastern's campus, you are a mask that travels around, trying to save the world. You take possession of different monsters who each have unique abilities to aid you in your quest to reach the Sky and push the RESET button so life can be normal again. Along the way, you'll have to fight your way through monsters, solve riddles, and befriend a character from Monster's, Inc. 

Good luck!
